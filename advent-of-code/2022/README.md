# Advent of Code 2022

https://adventofcode.com/2022

I'm going to try to knock out these problems with 3 different "languages": dbt, Python, and R (each with their respective folder in [src/](src))

Will be capturing the actual problem descriptions & text files in the [docs/](docs) folder - that way they're importable into the different code paths

Assumption of the src/ folder is that earlier days' solutions can be extended in later days...will see how this plays out :)
