# Advent of Code 2022 using Python

## How to run solutions

```text
python 2022/src/aoc2022_python/solutions.py # TODO: Should probably write a command line script that lets user select which day(s)/part(s) to run
```

This will print output like:

```text
Day 1 test(s) passed! Answer: 68802
Day 2 test(s) failed, need to fix
```

## Learnings & References (Python)

### Packaging & Modules

It's a bit overkill since could just script out the solutions, but looking to get better at this stuff!

- inital package structure setup: https://iq-inc.com/importerror-attempted-relative-import/
  - This tutorial proved pretty helpful for getting [src/aoc2022_python](src/aoc2022_python) set up as a Python package (that always takes forever, and I usually start by trying to relative import then end up going this route at the end)

### Object-Oriented Programming

More to come on this!

### Iteration

Somewhat experienced w/ this, but adding this section to give credit to references I used

- day_01: Locate indices of a given element in a list (in this example, the '\n' values)
